1. Deleting forums and topics [FIXED]
<br />
<b>Description:</b> Removal is not working as expected - it's always deleting the first record in the table.
<br />
<b>Recognition:</b> The problem is the script that shows the window with confirmaton. When clicking button it's not routing to particular id 
(beacuse it is not possible without returning a view), only the next "yes" button has this feature aswell as asp-action.
<br />
<b>Fix:</b> Just remove script and move all actions to one single button. It means losing cool javascript feature tho :(
<br />
<b>Ideas:</b> Maybe remake it into alert with ajax?
